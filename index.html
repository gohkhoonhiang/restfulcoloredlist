<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>This tutorial is an extension of my previous <a href="https://github.com/gohkhoonhiang/coloredlist">tutorial</a> on learning Tornado framework.</p>

<p>I have wanted to refactor the previous code base to make it more RESTful, but in the process of doing so, I found that it was actually pretty difficult and complicated to refactor the code. The difficulty is mostly due to lack of planning upfront and also because I have picked up some new knowledge along the way which makes the existing structure quite incompatible for a change.</p>

<p>As such, I have decided to start an entirely new repo. This time, I will try to plan more deliberately and keep in mind the practices of REST, so that I can write a more RESTful app this time.</p>

<p>I'm glad I started the previous tutorial, because it lead me to discover more about how most web apps out there write in RESTful style, so that I can apply what I have learnt in this new tutorial. Given that I have just started learning the concepts, I'm sure this tutorial will again be full of incorrect practices. As with the previous tutorial, I will discover such errors along the way, and will surely rewrite and rewrite and rewrite again and again and again.</p>

<p>With that said, you will probably find that I will make references to the previous tutorial. If you are unsure, you can always refer back to the previous tutorial and read the history of it to get a clearer picture of the story.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy this tutorial as much as the previous one. Again, feel free to file issues regarding the tutorial or the code itself. Thank you!</p>

<a id="redesign" class="anchor" href="#redesign" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Redesign</h1>

<p>I didn't really talk much about the design process in the previous tutorial, because frankly, there wasn't any. I was just taking literally everything out of the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/app-from-scratch-1-design/">reference</a>, including the template structure and CSS. Because of this, I didn't really put any thought into designing the page flow, user experience and client-server interaction.</p>

<a id="page-flow-redesign" class="anchor" href="#page-flow-redesign" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Page Flow Redesign</h2>

<p>Let's talk about the UI/UX design seriously now. In our Colored List App, there are only a few things that the user will need: a page to login, a page to see all items and perform CRUD actions, a page to change profile, and a page for new user to create an account. That will be a total of 4 pages.</p>

<p><strong>Legends:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>/</code> in <code>list.html</code> page indicates an <code>edit</code> button.</li>
<li>
<code>-</code> in <code>list.html</code> page indicates a <code>delete</code> button.</li>
<li>
<code>+</code> in <code>list.html</code> page indicates an <code>add</code> button.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you can understand the diagram drawn with pure ASCII characters above. Basically, it's a page flow diagram showing how the various pages in the app interact.</p>

<ol>
<li>When the user hits <code>/</code>, if he is logged in, then the <code>list.html</code> is rendered with all the existing items and a <code>Add New Item</code> form displayed. Otherwise, he is redirected to <code>login.html</code> to login with his username and password.</li>
<li>If the login is unsuccessful, an error message will be displayed. After which, the user may go to the <code>account_new.html</code> to sign up for an account.</li>
<li>If the login is successful, the user will see the <code>list.html</code> page.</li>
<li>From <code>list.html</code>, the user can go to <code>account.html</code> to view his profile and make changes to his passwords.</li>
<li>If the password update is successful, he will remain on the same page with no error message. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed below the form.</li>
<li>From the <code>account.html</code> page, the user can navigate back to the <code>list.html</code>.</li>
<li>If a new user signs up for an account successfully, he is immediately redirected to the <code>list.html</code> with an empty list where he can start adding new items. Otherwise, he will remain on the <code>account_new.html</code> with an error message displayed.</li>
<li>From the <code>account_new.html</code> page, the user may suddenly remember his login credentials and can navigate back to <code>login.html</code> page to perform login.</li>
</ol>
